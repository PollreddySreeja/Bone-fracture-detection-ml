## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Required libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib  
> Recommended: Python 3.10 (for TensorFlow compatibility), Use a virtual environment for dependency management.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### Backend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bone-fracture-detection-ml
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Run the main file:
```
python main.py
```
---

> Note: Ensure all required model files are present before running the application.

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- Accuracy: ~84%  
- Precision: ~0.85 (weighted) 
- Recall: ~0.84 (weighted) 
- F1-score: ~0.83 (weighted)
  
## 📊 Dataset

- Dataset used: MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs Dataset)  
- Total images available: 40,000+  
- Subset used: ~200+ images  

🔗 Dataset Link: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/

Includes bone types such as:
- Finger  
- Wrist  
- Elbow  
- Shoulder  
- Hand
- Head
- Chest
 > Note: Due to computational constraints, a subset of the dataset was used for training and evaluation.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Verify that all model files (`model.txt`, `X.txt.npy`, `Y.txt.npy`) are present inside the `model/` directory  
- Check image file paths and ensure supported formats (JPG, PNG)
- Ensure input images are properly preprocessed (resized to 32×32 and normalized)  
- If prediction errors occur, confirm that the feature vector shape matches the trained model input (3072 features)  
- Ensure compatible Python version (Python 3.x recommended)

  > Tip: Most issues arise from incorrect file paths, missing model files, or mismatched input dimensions.
